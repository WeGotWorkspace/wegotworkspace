# Meet signaling

Meet uses shared room session routes under `/api/v1/rooms/{roomId}/*` and meeting lifecycle under `/api/v1/meetings/rooms` (OpenAPI). Signaling is implemented in Laravel only:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `app/Services/Meet/MeetSignalingService.php` | PDO tables `meet_peers` / `meet_messages` via `DB::connection('wgw')` |
| `app/Services/Meet/MeetActorResolver.php` | Guest `sessionKey` and authenticated owner markers |
| `app/Services/Meet/MeetRequestAuth.php` | JWT bearer, `sabre_ui_auth` cookie, HTTP Basic |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/Rooms/RoomSessionController.php` | HTTP entry (meet + file collab dispatch) |
| `app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/Meetings/MeetingsController.php` | Room create / active probe |

Meet **UI** is in `packages/apps` (`meet-core`); client RTC channel is `meet`.

## HTTP mapping

| Action | Route |
|--------|-------|
| Join | `POST /rooms/{roomId}/participants` |
| Poll | `GET /rooms/{roomId}/events?peerId=&since=` |
| Send | `POST /rooms/{roomId}/events` |
| Leave | `DELETE /rooms/{roomId}/participants/{participantId}` |
| Chat | `POST /rooms/{roomId}/messages` |
| RTC config | `GET /rooms/{roomId}/configuration` |
| Room active | `GET /meetings/rooms/{roomId}` |

For meet rooms, `roomId` equals the room code (e.g. `daily-room`).

## Tests

```bash
cd packages/api && composer test -- --filter Meet
pnpm test:meet-api
```

Coverage includes guest join/poll/leave, `sessionKey` reuse on re-join, and room active probe.

## History

Migration from main-branch PDO signaling completed on branch `migrate/meet-api`: parity tests, staging validation, then removal of `packages/api/legacy/Voice/` and `WGW_VOICE_SIGNALING`. Schema migration v8 renames legacy `voice_*` tables and settings keys to `meet_*`. REST route revision (`refactor/api-routes`) moved meet HTTP from `/meet/*` to `/meetings/rooms` + `/rooms/{roomId}/*`.
