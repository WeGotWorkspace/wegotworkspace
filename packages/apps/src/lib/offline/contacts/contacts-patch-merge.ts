/**
 * Generic, spec-faithful JSContact (RFC 9553) PatchObject merge for the offline
 * contacts layer.
 *
 * `ContactCardPatch` patches emitted by the editor (`editDraftToPatch`) follow
 * the *nested-sparse-with-null-delete* convention, mirroring how the API server
 * applies them (`ConversionSupport::deepMergeContactCardPatch`):
 *
 * - **Id-keyed maps** (`emails`, `phones`, `links`, `organizations`, `notes`,
 *   `members`, …) are sparse — only changed ids are present. An entry value of
 *   `null` means "remove this id".
 * - **Nested objects** (e.g. `name`, or a single map entry's `contexts`) merge
 *   recursively, so unmanaged sibling fields survive a partial patch.
 * - **Arrays** (e.g. `name.components`, an address's `components`) replace
 *   wholesale — that is exactly how the editor emits them.
 * - **Scalars** replace.
 *
 * The merge is driven by value shape rather than a hardcoded field whitelist, so
 * every JSContact property (including ones the current editor does not touch) is
 * handled uniformly and losslessly.
