# Pull requests

Only open a PR when the user explicitly asks (e.g. "open a PR", "create a pull request").

## Before push

**Apps (`packages/apps/**`):** Husky pre-push runs `pnpm test:apps-done-gate` when apps files changed in the push range. Run it manually if hooks were skipped — targeted Vitest alone is insufficient for merge-ready UI work.

**Full stack before merge-ready PR** (when touching API or apps):

```bash
pnpm run ci:quality
```

For API contract work also run `pnpm test:api-done-gate` — see [testing](../testing/SKILL.md) and [developer/done-checklist.md](../developer/done-checklist.md).

Ensure commits are **signed** (required for merge to `main`).

**CI validates PR tip only** — `apps-quality` / `api-quality` run on branch HEAD. Intermediate commits may fail the done gate until fix-forward; do not treat old SHAs as merge blockers when HEAD is green ([#250](https://github.com/WeGotWorkspace/wegotworkspace/issues/250)).

## Push branch

```bash
git push -u origin HEAD
```

## Create PR (GitHub CLI)

```bash
gh pr create --title "type(scope): short description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
…

## Test plan
- [ ] …

EOF
)"
```

Use the repo template sections where applicable — see [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../../../.github/pull_request_template.md):

- **Summary** — what and why ([document](../document/SKILL.md) feature summary template)
- **Type of change** — check one box
- **How to test** — concrete steps ([testing](../testing/SKILL.md) commands)
- **Checklist** — local test, docs, tests updated
- **API changes** — only if `packages/api` touched (OpenAPI, `pnpm check:api-types`, feature tests)
- **Notes for reviewers** — trade-offs, follow-ups

PR title: same Conventional Commits style as commit subject when possible.

## Required CI (branch protection on `main`)

From root [README.md](../../../README.md):

- `build` (CI)
- `SAST (CodeQL JS/TS)`
- `SAST (Semgrep PHP)`
- `Secrets (Gitleaks)`
- `SCA (Trivy)`

Fix failing checks before expecting merge.

## Merging PRs

**Default: merge commit (`--merge`).** Preserve branch commits on `main` — feature work is split into small, auditable Conventional Commits; squashing collapses that history.

```bash
gh pr merge <number> --merge
```

Add `--delete-branch` only when the user asks to delete the remote branch after merge.

### When to use squash or rebase

Use **`--squash`** or **`--rebase`** only when the user explicitly requests it, or when the branch is intentionally a single commit (e.g. a one-line hotfix with no meaningful intermediate history).

**Do not** default to `--squash` because GitHub allows it or because a prior merge used squash. **Do not** infer squash from recent PR history — agents have mixed strategies in the past.

### Before merging

1. Confirm CI is green on the PR head (`gh pr checks <number>`).
2. Confirm the PR is mergeable (`gh pr view <number> --json mergeable,mergeStateStatus`).
3. Use the merge method above unless the user overrides.

### Recognizing merge style on `main`

| Style | `main` commit message | Parents |
|-------|----------------------|---------|
| Merge commit (default) | `Merge pull request #N from …` | 2 |
| Squash | `title (#N)` | 1 |

## Agent rules

- **Do not** add Cursor attribution to PR titles or bodies (`Made with Cursor`, `Made-with: Cursor`, `Co-authored-by: Cursor`, etc.). CI and project hooks reject it.
- **Do not** push or open PRs unless the user asks.
- **Do not** force-push `main`.
- **Do not** skip hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user explicitly requests it.
- **Do not** amend commits unless user requests it and amend rules are satisfied (unpushed, your commit, etc.).
- Use `gh` for all GitHub tasks (PR, checks, issues).
- **Merge with `--merge` by default** — see [Merging PRs](#merging-prs). Never use `--squash` unless the user asks.

## After PR

User may ask to address review comments or CI failures — fix on the same branch, push, re-run checks.
