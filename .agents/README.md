# Agent Skills (WeGotWorkspace)

Tool-agnostic agent skills following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) open standard. Compatible with Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, and other skills-aware agents.

## Naming

Skill directories use **unprefixed names** (e.g. `api`, `developer`, `storybook`) — never `wgw-` prefixes. Product terms like `wgw` DB connection or `@wgw-api-generated` in code are unrelated.

## Usage

Agents discover skills by `name` and `description` at startup, then load full `SKILL.md` instructions when a task matches. Path-scoped skills (`paths` frontmatter) activate when editing matching files.

Depth lives in sibling `.md` files (e.g. `api/layers.md`, `storybook/offline-first.md`) — load on demand.

**Policy vs enforcement:** [.agents/POLICY.md](POLICY.md). **Done verification:** [developer/done-checklist.md](skills/developer/done-checklist.md).

For repo-wide bootstrap and non-negotiable constraints, see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) at the repository root.
